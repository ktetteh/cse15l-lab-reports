# CSE 15L Lab Report 1

In this lab, I will be writing about the commands *cd, ls,* and *cat*.

## cd

For this command, when it is used with nothing, nothing appears.  This is not an error, because cd stands for change directory, and we are telling it to change directory to nothing with the 
statement we just typed.
